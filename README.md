#KandiSampler

Sales estimate calculator for magazines. Supports calculating estimates from, as well as selecting, random samples and then extrapolating estimates from those. Similiarity of selected samples is then compared to base set via Hellinger or Bhattacharyya distance of given propability distributions.

Created to provide my bachelors work at Helsinki University.
